- instead of getting clips and sorting by views:
    - get way more clips.
    - figure out average views for channel.
    - get clips above average for channel within date range.
    - random selection of above average clips.
    - will this work? are clips returned only by largest views? if so we can just evenlt distribute clips amongest listed streamers.

- add audio compressor
    - have setting specifically for streamers who distort their mic (dantes, tyler1) which reduces output gain.

- improve timer
    - we can use system clock for more accurate timing. 
    - but main problem is that the timing doesn't take into consideration load time of the clip.
        - we could add a fixed amount of time to make up for predicted delay - not very clean solution at all. 
            - could maybe calculate based on network connection? still janky af.
        - is there a way we can detect when clip starts playing without player function access?
            - inspect player html output see if we can use something there.

- add loading timer while clips load (takes a few seconds)

- make work in fullscreen (do we need to do fake fullscreen to stop player taking focus?)




****** DONE ******

- add auto go to next clip
    - don't have direct access to javascript functions on video player.
    - BUT we do have the duration of the clip returned in it's data, add a timeout that moves to next clip after this duration.
 
 - remove duplicates from clips array.
    - happens when we get get same clip from both streamerlist and gamelist.
